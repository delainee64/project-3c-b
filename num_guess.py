# Description: Write a program that prompts the user for an integer that the player will try to guess.
# If the player's guess is higher than the target integer, the program should display "too high"
# If the user's guess is lower than the target integer, the program should display "too low"
# Then the program should print how many guesses it took.

user = int(input("Enter the integer for the player to guess.\n"))
guess = int(input("Enter your guess.\n"))
num = 0

while True:  # while loop will continue until the guess is correct.
    num = num + 1  # num will count the number of attempts.
    if guess < user:
        guess = int(input("Too low - try again:\n"))
    elif guess > user:
        guess = int(input("Too high - try again:\n"))
    else:
        break  # break will exit the cycle

print('You guessed it in', num, 'tries.')
